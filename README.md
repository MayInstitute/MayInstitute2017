# May Institute 2017

The May Institute focuses on computational and statistical aspects of quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The course combines keynote presentations, introductory lectures, practical training, and informal personal discussions.

Instructors of the course are leading experts in this field, who contributed numerous experimental and computational methods and software. The target audience are both beginners and experienced scientists, who would like to strengthen their computational and statistical expertise. We also welcome computer scientists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, statisticians and engineers interested in learning about working with data from modern biotechnologies. The participants will have many opportunities to ask questions, and will be able to present their research.
